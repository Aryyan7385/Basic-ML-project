End-to-End Student Placement Prediction
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to predict student placement status. The model uses student CGPA and IQ scores to determine if they will be successfully placed. This project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment preparation.

Project Structure
end_toendml.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project workflow, from data loading to model saving.
data/: Contains the dataset used for the project.
placement.csv: The dataset with student CGPA, IQ, and placement status.
models/: Stores the trained machine learning model.
model.pkl: The trained Logistic Regression model saved using pickle.

Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
Data Preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned, and features are separated from the target variable.
Feature Scaling: The cgpa and iq features are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize their values.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, achieving a 90% accuracy score on the test set.
Deployment Preparation: The final trained model is saved using the pickle library, making it ready for deployment in a production environment.
